TI has a/o the INA210-214 and INA199
See a/o: http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slyb194a/slyb194a.pdf

Both are available at Conrad:

Both the INA199A1/B1 and the INA213A have a gain of 50, which appears to
be more than sufficient. We can always use a voltage divider at the
output towards the reference voltage.

Difference seems to be that the 199 has an accuracy of 1.5%, while the
213 has 1%. Both the 213 and the INA199A1 and INA199B1 have a bandwidth
of 80 kHz, which should be sufficient.

The 213 seems a bit better than the 199, and is also cheaper....




LT also has an interesting pdf on this subject:

At the page for the LT1797, there is an example for use as current
sensor:
