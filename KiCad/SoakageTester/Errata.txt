Known errors/issues.
====================


* The Bedini circuit around Q3 is incorrect. Only the spike recovery circuit
 (D1) is included, but not the coil activation connection to the collector of
Q3. 

* C7 has been placed close to U6 instead of close to U5. This has led to
  unnecesary long connections.
